# PCM-Based Voice Codecs
 
The project entails the development of a complete voice codec system using MATLAB and Simulink, achieved through the creation and integration of essential functions. These include a Sampler Function to capture input signals at specified sampling frequencies, a Quantizer Function offering mid-rise or mid-tread uniform quantization with customizable parameters, an Encoder Function to encode quantized bit streams using chosen signaling methods (Unipolar NRZ Signaling, or Polar NRZ Signaling) and user-defined parameters, and a Decoder Function to reverse the encoding process, decoding PCM-coded pulses into quantized samples. Through these interconnected functions, the project aims to construct a functional PCM-based voice codec that adeptly converts analog audio signals into digital formats, allowing for accurate signal transmission, recovery, and the mitigation of noise and interference challenges.
